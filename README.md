## **What Is This?**

**epd_core** is a ROS2 package that accelerates the **training** and **deployment** of **Computer Vision** (CV) models for industries. Unlike **easy_perception_deployment**, **epd_core** aims to integrate contemporary Detectron2 as well as restructure the vision processing workflow into more modular components for better debugging and higher performance. 

Rather than provide a general tool kit for ROS 2 ready vision-processing, **epd_core** focuses on higher **accuracy** and **performance** of object detection and pose estimation.
